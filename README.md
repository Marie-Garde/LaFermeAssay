# CHECKPOINT-4 - WILD CODE SCHOOL

We had 48h to make this project. I choose to start a website for my friend who started her farmhouse Inn with chinese medicine.

# Tech/framework used

- ReactJS (With redux and styled-components)
- NodeJS (With Express)
- MySQL

# SETUP :

To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/Marie-Garde/LaFermeAssay.git
    $ cd checkpoint-4/
    $ cd lafermedassay/
    $ npm start
```

Now you will need an another terminal to launch the backend server.
Go to the checkpoint-4/ folder and do those commands

```
    $ cd backend/
    $ node server.js
```

Add a .env file in the backend folder with those variables, and fill the variable with the correct values

```
DB_HOST=
DB_USER=
DB_PASS=
DB_SCHEMA=
BACK_PORT=
```
